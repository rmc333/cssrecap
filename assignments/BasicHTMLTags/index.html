    <h1> I can do all things through Christ who strenthens me!</h1>
    <p> I have been coding all day! I am 39 weeks pregnant, on one of my only days off, working so I can make the best life for my child.
        I have been sore, sleepy, and hungry, but I will keep going! I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. I needed to remind myself of this because this prework is due in a few days and I know I can get it done. 
        Some things I've done to help me through today have been:
        <ul>
            <li>taking power naps </li>
            <li>drinking refreshing beverages </li>
            <li>eating snacks</li>
            <li>listening to classical music</li>
        </ul>

    <p> Hopefully this information can encourage you to get a plan for when you are feeling stuck. All means ALL and that doesn't exclude coding. This is a website that might help if you ever need biblical encouragement. </p>
